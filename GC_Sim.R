# Create a class with three fields.
# peak: A vector that contains the position of peaks in the range of spectra.
# variance: A vector that contains the variances for different peaks.
# intensity: A vector that contains the intensity of the peaks.
# Window: A vector that contains the number of retention time to be affected
#         around the main peak.
# lowerlimit: A variable that set the minimum value for retention time.
# upperlimit: A variable that set the maximum value for retention time.
